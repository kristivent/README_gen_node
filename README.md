  ## Description
  This project created a working README generator using Nodejs to allow users to easily create and add a detailed README to an existing or new project.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to install node.js and then run the generator from the command line or terminal using the command node index.js.

  ## Usage
  The purpose is to help developers quickly and efficiently create a detailed README.md file in their repository.
  
  ## Contributing
  Open to contributions

  ## Tests
  Run node index.js and respond to the questions in the prompts.  Upon completion, a README.md file should be created in your working folder. Opening the file in Preview allows for interactivity.
  Sample README contained in "sampleREADME" folder and this README (for the full project) were both created using the generator for further testing.
